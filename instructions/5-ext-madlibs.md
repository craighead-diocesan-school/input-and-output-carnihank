# Mad Libs

## Task

Create a program to ask the user for a series of words, and then output a short story with those words filling the gaps. The user should not know the story before they give the words. This often makes the story silly.

You can use this story template if you wish:

*
"[exclamation]! he said [adverb] as he jumped into his convertible [noun] and drove off with his [adjective] wife."
*

## Example

`Give me an exclamation:` wow

`Give me an adverb:` loudly

`Give me a noun:` car

`Give me an adjective:` lovely

`Your story:`

`wow! he said loudly as he jumped into his convertible car and drove off with his lovely wife.`
