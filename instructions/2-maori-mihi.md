# Māori Mihi

Mihi (greeting) is an extremely important part of Māori culture. Before speaking in a formal setting (such as a marae) it is expected that you announce who you are and where you come from with a mihi. Through a mihi, others can make connections with your pepeha (iwi affiliations to particular natural landmarks) and your whakapapa/genealogy. A mihi has strong spiritual significance as you are speaking on behalf of your tīpuna (ancestors) as well as bringing them along for your kōrero.

## Task

Write a program to help the user create a mihi with the following structure:

> Tēnā koutou katoa,

> Ko [mountain] tōku maunga,

> Ko [river/ocean/lake/bay-harbour] tōku awa/moana/roto/whanga,

> Nō [home town] au,

> Ko [name] tōku ingoa,

> Tēnā koutou,

> Tēnā koutou,

> Tēnā koutou, katoa.

## Example

`Māori Mihi`

`This program will help you build a basic mihi.`

`First, you'll be asked a series of questions, then your mihi will be ready.`

`What is your name?` Jane

`What is your home town?` Timaru

`What is your iwi?` Ngāi Tahu

`What is your river, ocean, lake or bay-harbour?` Te Maru

`What is your mountain?` Aoraki

`Your mihi:`

`Tēnā koutou katoa,`

`Ko Aoraki tōku maunga,`

`Ko Te Maru tōku awa/moana/roto/whanga,`

`Ko Ngāi Tahu tōku iwi,`

`Nō Timaru au,`

`Ko Jane tōku ingoa,`

`Tēnā koutou,`

`Tēnā koutou,`

`Tēnā koutou, katoa.`

## Extension

Add two more pieces of information after the awa/moana/roto/whanga.

> Ko [vessel] tōku waka,

> Ko [people] tōku iwi,
