# Non-Māori Mihi

Mihi (greeting) is an extremely important part of Māori culture. Before speaking in a formal setting (such as a marae) it is expected that you announce who you are and where you come from with a mihi. Through a mihi, others can make connections with your pepeha (iwi affiliations to particular natural landmarks) and your whakapapa/genealogy. A mihi has strong spiritual significance as you are speaking on behalf of your tīpuna (ancestors) as well as bringing them along for your kōrero.

If you start with a line like 'Ko Aoraki te maunga', by naming a Māori mountain some people will assume you are Māori. It is up to you to decide what structure to use, but this guide uses an alternative approach for non-Māori given by a member of Ngāi Tahu that acknowledges ancestral landmarks without any potential confusion.

## Task

Write a program to help the user create a mihi with the following structure:

`Tēnā koutou,`

`Kei te mihi au ki a [mountain],`

`Kei te mihi au ki a [river/ocean/lake/bay-harbour],`

`Ko Te Tiriti o Waitangi te waka,`

`Ko Aotearoa te iwi,`

`Nō [home town] au,`

`Ko [name] tōku ingoa,`

`Tēnā koutou,`

`Tēnā koutou,`

`Tēnā koutou, katoa.`

## Example

`Māori Mihi`

`This program will help you build a basic mihi.`

`First, you'll be asked a series of questions, then your mihi will be ready.`

`What is your name?` Jane

`What is your home town?` Timaru

`What river, ocean, lake or bay-harbour do you associate with?` Te Maru

`What mountain do you associate with?` Aoraki

`Your mihi:`

`Tēnā koutou katoa,`

`Ko Aoraki tōku maunga,`

`Ko Te Maru tōku awa/moana/roto/whanga,`

`Ko Te Tiriti o Waitangi te waka,`

`Ko Aotearoa te iwi,`

`Nō Timaru au,`

`Ko Jane tōku ingoa,`

`Tēnā koutou,`

`Tēnā koutou,`

`Tēnā koutou, katoa.`
